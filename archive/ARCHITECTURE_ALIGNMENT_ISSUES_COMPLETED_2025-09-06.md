## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES BLOCKING IMPLEMENTATION

### **ISSUE #1: Database-API Schema Misalignment**
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority**: P0 - Must Fix First

**Problem Description:**
- API contracts in `api-contracts.md` reference database tables that don't exist in `database-architecture.md`
- Fundamental data model inconsistency prevents any backend development

**Root Cause Identified:**
The issue was a misunderstanding of the local-only architecture. The API contracts correctly implement local-only medical data storage, but had inconsistent table key references.

**Resolution Applied:**
- [x] Clarified local-only architecture in API contracts design philosophy
- [x] Updated database description to specify server-side tables only (no medical data)
- [x] Standardized encryption table_key_id references to "local_medical_data"
- [x] Verified Flutter app architecture contains all medical data tables locally
- [x] Confirmed no actual `medical_interpretations` table references exist
- [x] Verified chat system properly uses `serenya_content_id` linking

**Architecture Confirmed:**
- **Server-side database**: users, consent_records, subscriptions, payments, chat_options only
- **Local-only database**: serenya_content, lab_results, vitals, chat_messages (in Flutter app)
- **API contracts**: Correctly process and return medical data without server-side storage
- **Data flow**: Upload → S3 processing → API response → Local storage → S3 cleanup

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `/guidance/docs/technical/api-contracts.md` - Added local-only clarification, updated table_key_id references
- ✅ `/guidance/docs/technical/database-architecture.md` - Clarified server-side tables only

**Verification:**
- ✅ All medical data tables properly defined in Flutter app architecture
- ✅ API contracts align with local-only storage principle  
- ✅ Server database schema contains only non-medical tables
- ✅ Chat system properly integrated via serenya_content_id

### **ISSUE #2: Encryption Strategy Crisis - ✅ RESOLVED**
**Status**: 🟢 RESOLVED - Development Unblocked  
**Priority**: P0 - Security Blocker (COMPLETED)  
**Resolution Date**: September 5, 2025

**Problem Description:**
Fundamental contradiction in security architecture across multiple domains with irreconcilable conflicts between client-side and server-side encryption approaches.

**RESOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
Established **Hybrid Encryption Architecture** with clear boundaries and secure workflows:

**✅ Key Decisions Made:**
- **Device-Side**: Biometric authentication → Hardware key storage → Local database encryption
- **Server-Side**: Temporary decryption for AI processing only → AWS KMS for PII/payment data
- **Medical Data Flow**: Device encryption → S3 temp storage → Lambda decryption in memory → Bedrock processing → Response encryption → Device storage → S3 cleanup
- **Audit Logging**: Device-side logging for local content access + Server-side logging for all other events

**✅ Technical Implementation:**
- **VPC PrivateLink**: Bedrock communication stays within AWS private network
- **Secure Memory Management**: Plaintext medical data exists only temporarily in Lambda memory
- **Automatic S3 Cleanup**: Medical documents automatically deleted after processing (max 2 days)
- **AWS Bedrock Integration**: Server must decrypt documents for AI processing (Bedrock cannot process encrypted content)

**✅ Files Updated:**
- ✅ `/guidance/docs/technical/encryption-strategy.md` - Added hybrid model, Bedrock workflow, device-side audit logging
- ✅ `/guidance/docs/technical/database-architecture.md` - Confirmed local-only medical data architecture

Per CTO assessment, current documentation conflicts would result in:
- Non-compliant system that violates HIPAA requirements
- Potentially insecure architecture with encryption conflicts
- Unimplementable premium features threatening revenue model
- Poor user experience that harms adoption

### **EMERGENCY ARCHITECTURE WORKSHOP** 
**Required Attendees**: CTO, Legal Counsel, Engineering Lead, Product Manager, Security Engineer, Compliance Officer

**Agenda**:
1. **Issue #2**: Resolve encryption strategy crisis (client vs hybrid vs server-side)
2. **Issue #11**: Define HIPAA-compliant approach for local-only medical data
3. **Issue #13**: Decide premium feature architecture (local vs cloud-enabled)
4. **Issue #14**: Design legally compliant consent management system
5. **Issue #12**: Balance security requirements with user experience

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR WORKSHOP**
- [ ] Single authoritative encryption architecture decided and documented
- [ ] Legal compliance strategy approved by legal counsel
- [ ] Premium feature implementation approach confirmed
- [ ] User experience vs security balance agreed upon
- [ ] Implementation timeline updated with resolved architecture

### **POST-WORKSHOP ACTIONS**
- [ ] Update ALL affected documentation with consistent architecture

**Next Action**: **IMMEDIATELY** schedule emergency architecture alignment workshop to resolve P0 issues #2 and #11 before any development work continues.

**Timeline Impact**: 3-week delay for architecture alignment, but prevents 6+ months of rework and potential legal/security issues.

**Investment Required**: 2-3 weeks of focused architecture work to prevent massive downstream problems and ensure successful product launch.
