# RDS to DynamoDB Migration - Implementation Plan

## Stage 1: DynamoDB Infrastructure Setup
**Goal**: Deploy DynamoDB table with CDK infrastructure
**Success Criteria**: 
- DynamoDB table `serenya-users` deployed successfully
- GSI `EmailIndex` and `ExternalIdIndex` functional
- CloudWatch alarms configured
- Lambda functions have proper IAM permissions

**Tests**:
- `aws dynamodb describe-table` returns expected schema
- GSI queries work for email/external_id lookups
- CloudWatch alarms appear in AWS console

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Deploy CDK infrastructure from migration plan (Part 3, Section 3.1)
2. Verify table structure matches schema requirements
3. Test GSI functionality with sample queries
4. Validate CloudWatch integration

**Status**: Not Started

## Stage 2: Service Layer Implementation  
**Goal**: Implement DynamoUserService with single-object patterns
**Success Criteria**:
- DynamoUserService class created with all CRUD operations
- Single-object patterns implemented (current_device, current_session, etc.)
- Helper functions work with simplified data structure
- Unit tests pass for all service methods

**Tests**:
- User creation/retrieval works
- Email/external_id lookups functional
- Single-object updates work correctly
- Payment history operations function

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `DynamoUserService` class (Part 3, Section 3.2)
2. Implement simplified data structure handling
3. Add enhanced service layer helper functions
4. Write comprehensive unit tests

**Status**: Not Started

## Stage 3: Dual-Write Implementation
**Goal**: Run RDS and DynamoDB in parallel for validation
**Success Criteria**:
- All write operations go to both databases
- Data consistency maintained between systems
- Read operations still use RDS (no disruption)
- Monitoring shows successful dual writes

**Tests**:
- User registration creates records in both systems
- Updates sync correctly
- No write failures or inconsistencies
- Performance impact is minimal

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Implement dual-write pattern in auth service
2. Add data validation between systems
3. Monitor write performance and errors
4. Validate data consistency

**Status**: Not Started

---

## Stage 4: Read Migration & Validation
**Goal**: Switch reads to DynamoDB with RDS fallback
**Success Criteria**:
- All read operations use DynamoDB first
- Fallback to RDS works for missing data
- Performance improves or matches RDS
- No user-facing errors

**Tests**:
- Authentication works with DynamoDB reads
- Profile operations function correctly
- Subscription checks work
- Payment history accessible

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Implement read-with-fallback pattern
2. Monitor read performance metrics
3. Validate all user-facing features work
4. Gradual rollout with feature flags

**Status**: Not Started

---

## Stage 5: RDS Deprecation & Cleanup
**Goal**: Remove RDS dependency and finalize migration
**Success Criteria**:
- All operations use DynamoDB exclusively
- RDS instance safely removed
- Final cost targets achieved ($15-30/month)
- Data migration completely validated

**Tests**:
- All features work without RDS
- No orphaned data or broken references
- Cost monitoring shows expected savings
- Backup/recovery procedures validated

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Remove RDS fallback logic
2. Final data consistency check
3. RDS instance termination
4. Cost validation and monitoring setup

**Status**: Not Started

## Ready for Immediate Start

**Prerequisites Completed**:
✅ NAT Gateway removal already done ($90/month savings achieved)
✅ Migration plan finalized with single-object approach
✅ CDK infrastructure code ready for deployment
✅ Service layer patterns defined and tested
✅ Cost projections validated ($142/month → $15-30/month)

**Next Action**: Begin Stage 1 - Deploy DynamoDB infrastructure using the CDK code from the migration plan.

**Critical Implementation Note**: The migration uses a single-table design with simplified data structure where nested arrays have been converted to single objects (current_device, current_session, current_subscription, consents) while maintaining all field structures and business logic.
