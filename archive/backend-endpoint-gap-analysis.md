# Serenya Backend Endpoint Gap Analysis

**Date:** August 31, 2025  
**Status:** Backend Infrastructure Deployed - Missing App Management Endpoints  
**Analysis Scope:** Complete user flow coverage vs current backend implementation

---

## üìä **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Current Status:** The core Serenya backend infrastructure is fully deployed with 7 endpoints covering authentication and document processing. However, **25-30 additional endpoints are required** to support complete app management, settings, and administrative user flows.

**Critical Gap:** App management features (settings, preferences, legal document access, account management) cannot be implemented without additional backend endpoints.

2. **Legal Document Access Flow** - Terms/disclaimers not accessible
3. **Account Management Flow** - Profile updates impossible
4. **Biometric Setup Flow** - No biometric preference storage
5. **Data Export Flow** - GDPR compliance incomplete

### **Business-Critical Gaps**
1. **Premium Subscription Management** - Revenue features incomplete
2. **Notification Preferences** - User engagement limited
3. **Privacy Controls** - Trust-building features missing
4. **Account Deletion** - Legal compliance risk

### **Security & Trust Gaps**

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**Phase 1 Complete When:**
- Users can access and modify all basic settings
- Terms of Service and disclaimers accessible via API
- User profile updates functional
