# Serenya Flutter App - Test Environment Setup ✅

## Quick Test (Ready Now!)

**Run the basic test app:**
```bash
cd /Users/m00n5h075ai/development/serenya/serenya_app
./test_runner.sh web
```

This will:
- Open Chrome browser automatically
- Show a simple Serenya test screen
- Verify Flutter environment is working
- Test the basic UI components

## What You'll See

1. **Serenya logo and branding**
2. **Core messaging**: "We help you understand your lab results..."
3. **Test button**: Click to verify interactivity
4. **Status indicators**: Confirms everything is working

## Test Environment Status

✅ **Flutter SDK**: Installed and working (v3.24.0)  
✅ **Dependencies**: All packages installed  
✅ **Web Support**: Chrome browser ready  
✅ **Project Structure**: Complete Flutter app structure  
✅ **Basic UI**: Simple test interface working  

## Full Onboarding Implementation

The complete 4-slide onboarding flow has been implemented but has minor issues. The files are ready at:

```
lib/screens/onboarding/
├── onboarding_flow.dart        # Main navigation
├── slides/
│   ├── welcome_slide.dart      # Slide 1
│   ├── privacy_slide.dart      # Slide 2  
│   ├── disclaimer_slide.dart   # Slide 3
│   └── consent_slide.dart      # Slide 4
└── widgets/
    ├── onboarding_button.dart  # Styling
    └── progress_dots.dart      # Navigation dots
```

## Available Test Commands

```bash
# Run app in browser (recommended)
./test_runner.sh web

# Check code quality  
./test_runner.sh analyze

# Run tests
./test_runner.sh test

# Check Flutter environment
./test_runner.sh doctor
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test basic functionality**: `./test_runner.sh web`
2. **If working well**: Integrate full onboarding flow
3. **Add backend API**: Connect Google OAuth and health processing

## Known Limitations

- **Google Sign-In**: Requires OAuth2 setup and backend API
- **Health Processing**: Needs server endpoints  
- **Mobile Testing**: Requires Android Studio/Xcode for device testing

The basic Flutter environment is fully functional and ready for development!
