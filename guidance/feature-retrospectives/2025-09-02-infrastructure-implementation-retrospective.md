## 🚧 Implementation Challenges: What Didn't Go Well

### Challenge 1: PostgreSQL Version Compatibility Issues
**Issue:** Initial deployment failed with PostgreSQL version 15.4 not available in AWS RDS
**Impact:** Delayed deployment by ~30 minutes while researching available versions
**Root Cause:** CDK documentation lag - version 15.4 referenced but not supported in eu-west-1
**Resolution:** Updated to PostgreSQL 15.8 after checking AWS CLI for available versions
**Evidence:** CloudFormation deployment error: "Cannot find version 15.4 for postgres"

### Challenge 2: Lambda VPC Permissions Configuration
**Issue:** Lambda functions failed to deploy with VPC configuration due to missing IAM permissions
**Impact:** Additional 45 minutes troubleshooting and researching IAM policies
**Root Cause:** AWS documentation unclear on required VPC permissions for Lambda
**Resolution:** Added `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole` managed policy to Lambda execution role
**Evidence:** Deployment error: "execution role does not have permissions to call CreateNetworkInterface on EC2"

### Challenge 3: Database Connection Dependencies in Lambda Functions  
**Issue:** Runtime errors with Lambda functions missing `pg` module dependency
**Impact:** Authentication endpoint returning "Internal server error" during testing
**Root Cause:** Node.js Lambda deployment package missing PostgreSQL driver dependencies
**Resolution:** Identified but required additional dependency packaging configuration
**Evidence:** CloudWatch logs showing "Cannot find module 'pg'" errors

### Challenge 4: Infrastructure-as-Code Learning Curve
**Issue:** Complex CDK TypeScript syntax required significant research and iteration
**Impact:** Longer implementation time than expected for infrastructure components
**Root Cause:** Moving from simple configurations to enterprise-grade healthcare infrastructure
**Resolution:** Systematic approach using AWS CDK documentation and existing patterns
**Evidence:** Multiple CDK deployment iterations required for proper VPC/security configuration

### Challenge 5: Session Continuity Across Infrastructure Changes
**Issue:** DynamoDB to PostgreSQL migration required complete infrastructure replacement
**Impact:** Session handover complexity and verification requirements increased
**Root Cause:** Fundamental architecture change from NoSQL to relational database
**Resolution:** Comprehensive testing framework and deployment validation scripts
**Evidence:** Complete CDK stack replacement required vs. incremental updates
