## 🚧 Implementation Challenges: What Didn't Go Well

### Challenge 1: Session Crash Recovery Complexity
**Issue:** Previous session crashed during Epic 15/16 creation, requiring recovery analysis
**Impact:** Added ~30 minutes to project timeline for status analysis and recovery planning
**Root Cause:** Session interruption left unclear completion status requiring forensic analysis
**Evidence:** Had to review Linear tasks created today, compare against future-phases.md, identify gaps

### Challenge 2: Task ID Sequential Management  
**Issue:** Managing sequential Linear task IDs (M00-146 through M00-161) across session interruptions
**Impact:** Required careful tracking to avoid duplicate or skipped task numbers
**Root Cause:** No automated task ID management system for epic-level task creation
**Evidence:** Had to manually verify M00-146 through M00-153 were created, then continue with M00-154+

### Challenge 3: Template Consistency Across Large Volume
**Issue:** Maintaining comprehensive healthcare template quality across 16 complex tasks
**Impact:** Each task required 2,000+ words with consistent medical safety, compliance, handover sections
**Root Cause:** Manual template application without automated consistency checking
**Evidence:** Each task manually crafted with Prerequisites, Healthcare Compliance, QA Criteria, Medical Safety, Handover Documentation

### Challenge 4: Documentation Synchronization Lag
**Issue:** Future-phases.md and session handover updates lagged behind task creation
**Impact:** Risk of documentation drift and incomplete project status tracking
**Root Cause:** Multi-document updates not batched with task creation workflow
**Evidence:** Had to update future-phases.md separately after all tasks were created

### Challenge 5: Linear Priority/Label Inconsistency
**Issue:** Some tasks created with "Urgent" priority when should have been "Low" for Epic 16
**Impact:** Potential confusion in Linear project management and prioritization
**Root Cause:** Template had priority mismatch between Epic 16 low priority and individual task urgency
**Evidence:** M00-154 through M00-161 created with priority=1/"Urgent" but should be "Low" for months 6-18 timeline

**Rationale:** Today's session recovery was successful but manual - could be systematized

**Specific Addition:**
```markdown
### Session Crash Recovery Protocol
1. **Status Analysis**: Review Linear tasks created today with creation date filter
2. **Gap Identification**: Compare completed tasks against planned epic/project scope  
3. **Recovery Planning**: Document exact resumption point and remaining work
4. **Documentation Sync**: Update all project documents before resuming task creation
```

### Update 2: Epic Task Creation Methodology
**Document:** `/guidance/docs/project/linear-task-templates.md`
**Section:** New section - Epic-Level Task Management
**Required Update:** Add epic-level task creation methodology and template consistency requirements
