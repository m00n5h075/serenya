## üîÑ Team Coordination

### **Agent Workflow System**
This project uses systematic AI agent coordination with validation requirements between handoffs. All agents must:

1. **Validate predecessor work** before starting new tasks
2. **Document progress systematically** using TodoWrite
3. **Update Linear task status** appropriately
4. **Complete handoff documentation** for next agent

**‚û°Ô∏è [See Agent Workflow Protocol](./agent-workflow-protocol.md) for detailed procedures**

### **Task Management**
- **Primary System:** Linear for task tracking and status
- **Task Templates:** Standardized templates for consistent task creation
- **Status Definitions:** `agent_ready`, `agent_active`, `agent_blocked`, `agent_complete`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

### **Medical Safety Risks (Highest Priority)**
- **Mitigation:** Conservative interpretation bias, confidence scoring, clear disclaimers
- **Monitoring:** AI confidence metrics, safety incident tracking
- **Escalation:** Automatic medical consultation recommendations for concerning values

### **Technical Risks**
- **AI Processing Failures:** 10-15% expected - graceful error handling with recovery paths
- **Scale Challenges:** Auto-scaling infrastructure with cost monitoring
- **Data Security:** End-to-end encryption, GDPR/HIPAA compliance

### **Business Risks**
