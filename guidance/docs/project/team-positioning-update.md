# Serenya Team Positioning Update
**Date:** August 24, 2025  
**Status:** FINAL - All Documentation Updated

## Refined Positioning Summary

Based on founder feedback, we've refined our positioning from the earlier "wellness information organizer" approach to maintain our core value proposition:

### Core Positioning
- **Serenya is an AI Health Agent** - "Your friendly AI nurse"
- **Provides medical interpretation** of lab results (NOT just educational content)
- **Builds ongoing health relationships** with users
- **Pricing remains €9.99/month** (not €4.99 as previously discussed)
- **Avoids medical device classification** through "interpretation assistance" vs "diagnostic tool"

### Key Messaging
**Primary Value Prop:** "Your friendly AI nurse that helps you understand your lab results and empowers better conversations with your healthcare provider."

**Core Benefits:**
1. **Clarity** - Medical interpretation in plain language you can understand
2. **Confidence** - Feel prepared and empowered in healthcare conversations
3. **Context** - Understand your health story over time  
4. **Connection** - Strengthen your relationship with healthcare providers

## Team Impact Summary

### CTO Impact:
- **Maintain medical-grade AI interpretation capabilities** (not simplified educational AI)
- **Same 3-6 month timeline** remains valid
- **Regulatory approach unchanged** - avoid medical device through positioning
- **Tech stack recommendations remain** (Next.js + Supabase + Anthropic Claude)

### Product Manager Impact:
- **Revert to original PRD v2 feature set** and pricing model
- **€9.99/month pricing confirmed** (not €4.99)
- **Core features unchanged**: Upload → Medical interpretation → Doctor reports
- **MVP timeline**: 3-6 months maintained

### UI/UX Designer Impact:
- **"AI nurse relationship" design language** vs educational platform
- **Maintain warm, trustworthy, empathic** brand feel
- **Medical interpretation interface** not educational content presentation
- **Relationship-building UX patterns** vs learning tools

### Marketing Specialist Impact:
- **Much stronger value proposition** - AI medical interpretation vs wellness organization
- **Target demographic confirmed** - 35-50 health-conscious adults
- **Market position**: "AI nurse/interpretation assistant" 
- **Pricing strategy**: €9.99 reflects true medical interpretation value

## Legal Protection Strategy
- **Clear disclaimers**: "Medical interpretation assistance, not medical advice"
- **Positioning boundary**: "Like having a nurse friend explain results"
- **Avoid diagnostic claims** while maintaining interpretation value
- **Regulatory benefits maintained** - no medical device classification needed

## Documentation Status
✅ **PRD v2** - Updated with AI Health Agent positioning  
✅ **PR/FAQ** - Updated with "friendly AI nurse" messaging  
✅ **Customer Reviews** - Already aligned (no changes needed)  
✅ **Positioning Pivot Document** - Reflects refined approach  

## Next Steps
1. **Technical implementation** can proceed with original PRD v2 scope
2. **Design work** should focus on AI health relationship patterns
3. **Marketing messaging** should emphasize AI nurse interpretation value
4. **Development timeline** remains 3-6 months to launch

This refinement maintains 100% of our planned functionality while preserving regulatory protection and market differentiation.
