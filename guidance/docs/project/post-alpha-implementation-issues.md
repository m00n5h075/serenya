- **Audit Logging Impact**: Database and system performance with comprehensive logging  
- **Security vs UX Balance**: Real-time user experience with full security stack
- **Mobile Device Variations**: Performance across different hardware capabilities
- **Network Performance**: Impact of encryption and logging under various network conditions

#### **Current Mitigation (Already Implemented):**
- âœ… **Performance budgets defined** with specific targets (`flutter-app-architecture.md`)
- âœ… **Optimization strategies documented** (lazy encryption, background encryption, key caching)
- âœ… **Monitoring framework** integrated with budget tracking
- âœ… **Risk mitigation strategies** defined for encryption operations

#### **Post-Alpha Resolution Actions:**
- [ ] **Device Testing**: Measure encryption performance across different mobile hardware

### **CATEGORY 2: Payment & Business Model Integration**
**Consolidated from Issues #10 + #15**  
**Priority**: P2 - Revenue Generation  
**Dependencies**: Core functionality validation + monetization strategy confirmation

#### **Original Issues Merged:**
- **Issue #10**: Payment Integration Incomplete  
- **Issue #15**: Business Model vs Technical Architecture

#### **Problem Summary:**
Premium subscription business model requires complete payment processing architecture, but this is appropriately deferred until core functionality is validated through user testing. Payment integration is not required for alpha phase user validation.

- **Mobile Payment Integration**: Apple/Google Pay integration with webhook handling
- **Subscription Management**: Validation, renewal, and billing processes
- **Premium Feature Gating**: Technical integration with payment status
- **Payment Audit Logging**: Integration with existing compliance framework
- **Security Integration**: Payment security aligned with overall encryption strategy

#### **Business Model Context:**
- **Revenue Target**: â‚¬9.99/month premium subscription
- **Premium Features**: AI-generated professional medical reports
- **Market Validation**: Payment integration deferred until user demand is proven
- **Alpha Focus**: Core functionality validation without monetization complexity

#### **Post-Alpha Resolution Actions:**
- [ ] **Payment Architecture**: Define PCI DSS compliant payment processing system
- [ ] **API Integration**: Add payment processing endpoints to API contracts
- [ ] **Mobile SDKs**: Implement Apple/Google payment integration
- [ ] **Webhook Handling**: Define secure webhook processing for payment events
- [ ] **Subscription Logic**: Implement validation and renewal processes
- [ ] **Premium Gating**: Technical integration with subscription status
- [ ] **Audit Integration**: Payment events integrated with compliance logging
- [ ] **Security Alignment**: Payment security consistent with encryption strategy
- [ ] **Billing Processes**: Automated billing, invoicing, and payment failure handling

#### **Success Metrics:**
- Payment conversion rate > 15% from free to premium
- Payment processing reliability > 99.5% uptime
- PCI DSS compliance certification achieved
- Average payment processing time < 3 seconds
- Subscription renewal rate > 80% monthly
