# Serenya Linear Task Templates

Based on our agent specializations and development workflow, here are the standardized task templates for different types of work in Linear.

## AI Agent Optimization Guidelines

**For Maximum AI Agent Comprehension:**
- All requirements written in clear, numbered lists
- Technical specifications use standard formats (JSON, YAML, SQL)
- Every task includes explicit testing criteria for QA validation
- Handover documentation required for seamless agent transitions
- Success criteria measurable with specific metrics

## **Agent Workflow Integration**

**MANDATORY**: Every task must include prerequisite validation and proper handoff following the [Agent Workflow Protocol](./agent-workflow-protocol.md).

### Task Prerequisites Section
Add this section to every task description:
```
## Prerequisites & Dependencies
**Required Completed Tasks**: [List specific Linear task IDs that must be finished]
**Environment Requirements**: [System state, deployed services, database schema]
**File Dependencies**: [Existing files/configurations this task will modify]
**Access Requirements**: [Credentials, permissions, API keys needed]
```

### Validation Requirements
Before starting any task, the assigned agent must:
1. **Verify prerequisites** using objective criteria (not assumptions)
2. **Document validation results** in Linear task comments  
3. **Update task status** to `agent_active` only after validation passes

## General Task Structure

All tasks should include:
- **Clear Title** - Action-oriented (e.g., "Implement", "Create", "Build", "Configure")
- **Agent Assignment** - Which specialized agent owns this task
- **Priority Level** - Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Labels** - Component, priority, medical/compliance tags
- **Estimate** - Story points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
- **Epic Link** - Parent epic this task belongs to
