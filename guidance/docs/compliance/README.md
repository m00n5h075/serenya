- **Retention Management**: Automated 7-year retention with secure deletion
- **Lambda Integration**: Auth, Process, and Payment function audit logging

**Dependencies**: 
- `database-architecture.md` (audit table schemas)
- `encryption-strategy.md` (security event integration)
- `system-architecture.md` (AWS CloudTrail integration)

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete schema + processing logic defined

- **Client-Side**: Device biometric authentication + local medical data encryption
- **Network**: TLS 1.3 + application-layer encryption for medical data transmission
- **Database**: Full table encryption (payments, audit) + field-level encryption (users, content)

### **Data Retention & Disposal**
- **Standard Retention**: 7 years for all compliance-related data
- **Secure Deletion**: Cryptographic key deletion + database overwrite
- **Legal Hold**: Suspension of deletion for litigation/investigation
- **Automated Cleanup**: Daily retention policy enforcement
