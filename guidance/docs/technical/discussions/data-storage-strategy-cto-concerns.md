# CTO Technical Concerns - Data Storage Strategy

**Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Decision**: Store user health data locally on devices, not on Serenya's servers  
**Status**: Under Review  

## Critical Technical Changes Required

### Infrastructure Redesign
- **AWS Healthcare Services**: HealthLake, Comprehend Medical become processing-only, not storage
- **FHIR R4 Database**: No longer centralized - need device-local FHIR compliance strategy
- **Processing Pipeline**: Complete redesign for stateless, ephemeral operations

### Mobile-Native Development Decision
- **Technology Stack**: Choose React Native vs Flutter vs native development
- **Timeline Impact**: Mobile-first development more complex than web
- **Resource Allocation**: Focus all development on mobile instead of web + mobile

### Device Storage Architecture
- **Local Database**: Implement SQLite + encryption for health records
- **iOS Security**: Keychain integration for secure key management
- **Android Security**: Keystore integration for secure key management
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient local storage with user-controlled limits

### Sync Strategy
- **User-Controlled Backup**: iCloud/Google Drive integration without server dependencies
- **Cross-Device Strategy**: How users access data across multiple devices
- **Data Portability**: Export mechanisms for healthcare provider sharing

## Major Technical Risks

### 1. Data Loss Risk
- **Primary Concern**: Users lose phones = lose all health history
- **Mitigation Needed**: Robust backup/restore mechanisms
- **User Education**: Clear communication about backup responsibility

### 2. Cross-Device Access Limitations
- **Challenge**: No seamless multi-device experience
- **Impact**: Users expect cloud-synchronized experience
- **Solution Required**: User-managed sync strategy

### 3. Processing Power Constraints
- **Question**: Complex AI operations on-device vs cloud
- **Consideration**: Mobile processing limitations for large medical documents
- **Architecture Decision**: Hybrid processing model needed

### 4. Development Complexity
- **Reality**: Mobile-first architecture more complex than responsive web
- **Resource Impact**: Higher development and maintenance costs
- **Team Skills**: Need mobile development expertise

## Immediate Technical Questions

### AI Processing Strategy
1. How do we handle AI processing that requires significant compute power?
2. Can we run medical interpretation models on-device effectively?
3. What's the hybrid model for cloud processing without data storage?

### Data Management
1. What's our approach to user data portability between devices?
2. How do we maintain FHIR compliance without centralized storage?
3. What's the local data backup and restore user experience?

### Integration Challenges
1. How do we integrate with healthcare providers without central data sharing?
2. What's our strategy for emergency medical access to user data?
3. How do we handle software updates and data migration?

## Technical Architecture Implications

### Current AWS Infrastructure Changes
- **HealthLake**: Processing-only, no permanent FHIR storage
- **Comprehend Medical**: Ephemeral NLP processing
- **Textract**: Document processing without storage
- **Lambda Functions**: Stateless processing pipelines
- **API Gateway**: Mobile-optimized, processing-only endpoints

### New Mobile Architecture Requirements
- **Offline Capability**: Core features must work without internet
- **Local Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all health data
- **Secure Storage**: Platform-native secure storage integration
- **Background Processing**: On-device AI processing capabilities
- **Data Sync**: User-controlled cloud backup mechanisms

### Development Stack Considerations
- **React Native**: Cross-platform efficiency, familiar to team
- **Flutter**: Performance benefits, growing ecosystem
- **Native Development**: Maximum platform integration, higher cost
- **Hybrid Approach**: Web components with native storage layer

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Implement robust local backup systems** with user-friendly interfaces
2. **Design graceful degradation** for offline scenarios
3. **Create comprehensive data recovery procedures**
4. **Build extensive offline testing frameworks**

### Business Risks  
1. **User education campaigns** about device-based storage benefits
2. **Emergency access protocols** for healthcare integration
3. **Data export tools** for healthcare provider sharing
4. **Migration assistance** for users switching devices

## Next Steps - Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Architecture Design
1. **Technology stack final decision** (React Native vs Flutter vs Native)
2. **Local storage architecture specification**
3. **AI processing model design** (on-device vs hybrid)
4. **Backup/restore system design**

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept
1. **Local encryption implementation**
2. **Basic FHIR record storage on device**
3. **Cloud processing pipeline without storage**
4. **Backup/restore prototype**

### Phase 3: Integration
1. **Healthcare provider data export**
2. **Emergency access protocols**
3. **Multi-device sync strategy**
4. **Comprehensive testing framework**

## Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Conduct technology stack evaluation** - 2 weeks
2. **Design local storage architecture** - 1 week  
3. **Prototype backup/restore flows** - 2 weeks
4. **Validate AI processing constraints** - 1 week

### Long-term Technical Investments
1. **Mobile development team expansion**
2. **Device security expertise acquisition**
3. **Offline AI processing capabilities**
4. **Healthcare integration protocols**
