# QA Engineer - Simplified Data Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Flutter app with device storage, non-critical medical role  

## Understanding ✅

- **Flutter Testing**: Mobile app testing focus (not web)
- **Local Storage Testing**: Device encryption and data integrity
- **Server Processing Testing**: Temporary file processing with retry
- **Non-Emergency Role**: No emergency access testing needed
- **Acceptable Data Loss**: Device loss testing not critical path

## Key Questions - ANSWERED ✅

1. **Flutter Testing Framework**: Preferred testing tools for Flutter health app?
   - **ANSWER**: QA Engineer's prerogative - align with CTO and decide

2. **Local Encryption Testing**: How to validate device encryption implementation?
   - **ANSWER**: Test on virtual devices

3. **Processing Pipeline Testing**: Test temporary server storage and cleanup?
   - **ANSWER**: Test negative cases and validate that no data is persisted

4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: iOS vs Android Flutter implementation differences?
   - **ANSWER**: Validate and cross-check both versions to assure standard behavior

## QA Engineer Next Steps

1. **Collaborate with CTO** on Flutter testing framework selection
2. **Set up virtual device testing** for encryption validation
3. **Design negative testing** for server storage cleanup verification
4. **Create cross-platform validation** testing for iOS/Android Flutter consistency

## Testing Strategy Focus

- **Framework Selection**: Choose optimal Flutter testing tools with CTO input
- **Virtual Device Testing**: Comprehensive encryption testing without physical devices
- **Negative Case Testing**: Verify no data persistence after processing
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensure identical behavior across iOS/Android
