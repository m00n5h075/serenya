# Medical User Advocate - Simplified Data Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Non-critical health companion with device storage  

## Understanding ✅

- **Non-Emergency Tool**: Not for medical emergencies or critical treatment
- **Health Companion Role**: Interpretation and education, not medical care
- **Privacy Focus**: User data protection prioritized over convenience
- **Acceptable Data Loss**: Device-based storage with user backup responsibility
- **No Critical Integration**: Not part of healthcare provider workflow

## Key Questions - ANSWERED ✅

1. **Medical Disclaimers**: How prominent should "not for emergencies" messaging be?
   - **ANSWER**: Already part of onboarding flow. Add "Disclaimers" page in App Settings for reference

2. **User Education**: What medical risks need disclosure about data loss?
   - **ANSWER**: NO medical risks for losing Serenya data - original files are what users should refer to. Make data loss risk clear alongside privacy/safety benefits of local storage

3. **Interpretation Limits**: Clear boundaries on medical advice scope?
   - **ANSWER**: Serenya does not offer any medical advice. Add to new disclaimers page.

4. **Conservative Bias**: How conservative should AI interpretations be?
   - **ANSWER**: Conservative enough to avoid tangents, but not so much that it becomes useless

## Medical Advocate Next Steps

1. **Create Disclaimers Page**: Design App Settings disclaimers page with:
   - "Not for emergencies" messaging
   - "Does not offer medical advice" statement
   - Other relevant medical disclaimers

2. **Define Conservative AI Bias**: Balance between useful interpretation and medical caution

## Medical Risk Clarification ✅

- **No Medical Risk from Data Loss**: Losing Serenya interpretations has no medical consequences
- **Original Files Priority**: Users should always refer to original medical documents
- **Privacy Benefit Education**: Emphasize privacy and safety benefits outweigh data loss risk
