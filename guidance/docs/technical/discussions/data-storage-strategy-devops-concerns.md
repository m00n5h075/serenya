# DevOps Technical Concerns - Data Storage Strategy

**Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Decision**: Store user health data locally on devices, not on Serenya's servers  
**Status**: Under Review  

## Infrastructure Transformation Overview

This decision **completely transforms our AWS infrastructure strategy** from a storage-heavy healthcare platform to a processing-only service architecture.

## Infrastructure Simplification Benefits

### Massive Cost Reduction ✅
- **No RDS Storage**: Eliminate database hosting, backup, and maintenance costs
- **No DynamoDB**: Remove NoSQL storage and read/write capacity costs  
- **No HealthLake Storage**: Eliminate FHIR storage costs and management overhead
- **Reduced Data Transfer**: Lower egress costs with processing-only workflows
- **Simplified Backup**: No server-side backup infrastructure needed

### Compliance Simplification ✅
- **Reduced HIPAA Surface Area**: No PHI storage = dramatically reduced compliance scope
- **No Data Breach Risk**: Cannot breach data we don't store
- **Simplified Audit Requirements**: Processing-only workflows easier to audit
- **Reduced BAA Complexity**: Fewer AWS services require Business Associate Agreements

### Processing Pipeline Requirements ⚠️
- **Still Need Secure Processing**: Lambda/ECS for AI processing remains critical
- **Ephemeral Data Handling**: New patterns for secure temporary processing
- **Memory Management**: All processing must happen in memory without persistence

## New Architecture Requirements

### Ephemeral Processing Infrastructure
```
User Device → API Gateway → Lambda/ECS → AI Processing → Results → User Device
                                    ↓
                              Delete Immediately
```

- **Stateless Processing**: All APIs become processing-only with no persistence
- **In-Memory Operations**: All data processing happens in RAM
- **Immediate Cleanup**: Automatic data deletion after processing completion
- **Session Isolation**: Each processing session completely isolated

### Session Management
- **Temporary Processing Tokens**: Secure session management without data storage
- **Processing Timeouts**: Automatic cleanup for abandoned processing sessions
- **Memory Limits**: Strict memory allocation to prevent data leakage
- **Audit Logging**: Processing events without storing PHI content

### API Gateway Configuration
- **Stateless Endpoints**: All endpoints designed for single-request processing
- **File Upload Handling**: Direct processing of uploaded medical documents
- **Result Streaming**: Real-time results delivery without intermediate storage
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures without data persistence

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Processing-Only Metrics**: New monitoring patterns for stateless workflows
- **Performance Tracking**: Response times and processing efficiency
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Failed processing attempts and recovery
- **Cost Optimization**: Processing cost per user interaction

## Critical DevOps Questions

### Data Residency & Compliance
**Question**: Do we need data residency controls for temporary processing?
- **Consideration**: Even temporary processing may need to comply with regional data laws
- **Impact**: May need region-specific Lambda deployment
- **Decision Needed**: Which AWS regions for processing operations

### Audit & Logging Strategy
**Question**: How do we audit processing without storing logs containing PHI?
- **Challenge**: Need audit trails without PHI exposure
- **Solution Options**: Metadata-only logging, anonymized processing logs
- **Compliance Requirement**: HIPAA audit requirements for access and processing

### Disaster Recovery Without Data Control
**Question**: What's our disaster recovery plan when we don't control the data?
- **New Reality**: Cannot recover user data - users responsible for their own backups
- **Focus Shift**: Disaster recovery for processing capabilities only
- **Service Continuity**: Maintaining AI processing availability

### Processing Reliability
**Question**: How do we ensure reliable processing without retry mechanisms?
- **Challenge**: Cannot retry failed operations if we don't store input data
- **Solution**: Real-time retry within single session only
- **User Experience**: Clear failure handling and retry instructions

## Infrastructure Architecture Changes

### Current AWS Services - Modified Roles

#### Compute Services
- **Lambda Functions**: Ephemeral processing only, no persistent storage
- **ECS/Fargate**: Stateless containers for complex AI processing
- **API Gateway**: Mobile-optimized, processing-only endpoints

#### Storage Services (Eliminated)
- ~~**RDS**: No longer needed for user data storage~~
- ~~**DynamoDB**: No user data storage requirements~~
- ~~**S3 User Data**: No persistent user file storage~~

#### Healthcare Services - Processing Only
- **Comprehend Medical**: NLP processing without result storage
- **Textract**: Document processing, results returned immediately
- **HealthLake**: May not be needed if no FHIR storage required

#### Security Services
- **WAF**: Protect processing endpoints
- **KMS**: Encrypt temporary processing data
- **Secrets Manager**: API keys and processing credentials
- **IAM**: Least privilege for processing-only operations

### New Infrastructure Components

#### Ephemeral Processing Pipeline
```yaml
API_Gateway:
  - Mobile-optimized endpoints
  - File upload handling
  - Response streaming

Lambda_Processing:
  - Medical document interpretation
  - AI processing workflows
  - Immediate result delivery
  - Automatic cleanup

Monitoring:
  - Processing success/failure rates
  - Response time metrics
  - Cost per processing operation
  - Error pattern analysis
```

## Implementation Phases
