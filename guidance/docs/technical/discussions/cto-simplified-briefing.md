# CTO - Simplified Data Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Device-only storage with Flutter mobile app  

## Understanding ✅

- **Local Storage**: User health data on device only (Flutter/SQLite)
- **Server-Side AI**: All processing server-side, temporary file storage for retry
- **Flutter Development**: Single mobile platform
- **No Emergency Role**: Not emergency tool, no critical medical workflow
- **Data Loss Acceptable**: Device loss = data loss (no redundancy)

## Key Questions - ANSWERED ✅

1. **Temporary Storage Duration**: How long keep files server-side during processing?
   - **ANSWER**: Keep files only during request processing, delete after success/terminal failure. Delete any file older than 24 hours.

2. **Retry Mechanism**: Max retries before terminal failure?
   - **ANSWER**: Maximum 3 retries, progressively spaced out

3. **File Size Limits**: Processing limits for temporary storage?
   - **ANSWER**: 5 MB maximum file size

4. **Local Encryption**: Flutter encryption approach for health data?
   - **ANSWER**: Yes, implement Flutter local encryption

## CTO Next Steps

1. **Consult with Backend Engineer** on REST vs alternative API approaches for Flutter
2. **Design Progressive Retry Logic**: Architecture for 3-attempt retry with increasing delays
3. **24-Hour Cleanup Architecture**: Failsafe cleanup system for orphaned files
4. **Flutter Encryption Specification**: Define local health data encryption approach

## Technical Clarifications - ANSWERED ✅

1. **Progressive Retry Timing**: Specific delay intervals (e.g., 30s, 2min, 5min)?
   - **ANSWER**: CTO to determine appropriate timing intervals

2. **Flutter Database**: SQLite with built-in encryption or separate encryption layer?
   - **ANSWER**: CTO decision - recommend best approach for Flutter health data

3. **File Storage Security**: S3 encryption at rest configuration for temporary PHI?
   - **ANSWER**: Yes, implement S3 encryption for temporary PHI storage

4. **Processing Timeout**: Maximum processing time before considering request failed?
   - **ANSWER**: Default 3 minutes, adjust based on testing and average request duration

## CTO Technical Decisions Required

1. **Design Progressive Retry Intervals**: Recommend timing for 3-attempt retry sequence
2. **Flutter Encryption Architecture**: Choose optimal encryption approach for local health data
3. **API Architecture**: Collaborate with Backend Engineer on REST vs alternative approaches
