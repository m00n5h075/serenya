# Serenya AI Health Agent - Cross-Team Implementation Consensus

**Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Decision**: Device-only storage with Flutter mobile app  
**Status**: All agents aligned and ready for implementation  

---

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### 1. API Architecture Decision (CTO + Backend Engineer)
**Decision: REST API with JSON responses**
- **Rationale**: Flutter's http package provides excellent REST support with built-in JSON serialization
- **Implementation**: RESTful endpoints with standardized error codes and response formats
- **Future consideration**: WebSocket for real-time features in Phase 2, but REST covers all MVP needs
- **Error handling**: HTTP status codes with detailed JSON error objects for user-friendly messaging

### 2. Testing Framework Alignment (CTO + QA Engineer)
**Decision: Flutter Integration Testing Suite**
- **Tools selected**:
  - `flutter_test` for unit tests
  - `integration_test` for end-to-end testing
  - `flutter_driver` for complex UI automation
- **Encryption testing**: Mock secure storage with test key rotation
- **Device testing**: Firebase Test Lab for iOS/Android consistency validation
- **Coverage target**: 85% code coverage for core health data processing

### 3. S3 Architecture (DevOps)
**Decision: Per-user folder structure with 1-hour cleanup**
- **Structure**: `temp-processing/{user_id}/{session_id}/`
- **Cleanup**: Lambda function every hour (aligns with 3-min processing + retry buffer)
- **Security**: S3 bucket encryption + IAM policies restricting access to processing service only
- **Cost optimization**: S3 Intelligent Tiering disabled (files deleted too quickly)

### 4. Progressive Retry Timing (CTO)
**Decision: 30 seconds → 2 minutes → 5 minutes (3 total attempts)**
- **Rationale**: Allows for temporary network issues without excessive battery drain
- **Implementation**: Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
- **User feedback**: Progress indicator shows "Retrying in X seconds" with option to cancel
- **Failure handling**: After 3 attempts, offer manual retry or save for later

### 5. Flutter Encryption Approach (CTO)
**Decision: SQLite with separate encryption layer**
- **Implementation**: `sqflite_cipher` package for encrypted SQLite
- **Key management**: Flutter Secure Storage for encryption keys
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for large datasets, encrypted indexes for search
- **Backup exclusion**: Encrypted database automatically excluded from device backups

## Disclaimer Strategy Consensus (Product Manager + UI/UX Designer + Medical Advocate)

### Layered Disclaimer Approach:
1. **Onboarding Screen**: "This app is for informational purposes only and does not provide medical advice"
2. **Settings Page**: Comprehensive disclaimers section with legal language
3. **Export Feature**: Additional disclaimer before PDF generation
4. **Conservative AI messaging**: "Consider consulting healthcare professionals" in AI responses

## Minimal Backup Education Strategy (Product Manager + UI/UX Designer + Marketing Specialist)

### Balanced Approach:
- **Onboarding**: Single screen explaining device-only storage as a privacy benefit
- **Messaging**: "Your data stays private on your device" (positive framing)
- **User control**: Settings toggle for "Remind me about data backup" (default: off)
- **Documentation**: FAQ section for users who want more technical details

## MVP Requirements Updates

### Core Features Finalized:
1. **Health data processing**: 3-minute timeout, device-only storage
2. **Local encryption**: SQLite with sqflite_cipher
3. **Timeline navigation**: Chronological health record view
4. **Progressive retry**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
5. **Export functionality**: Basic PDF generation (not premium in MVP)
6. **Disclaimers**: Onboarding + Settings integration

### Premium Feature Scope (Product Manager Decision):
**Medical Report Export moved to MVP** - Basic PDF export included, premium features for Phase 2:
- Advanced report customization
- Multiple export formats
- Historical trend analysis
- Integration with health apps

## Future Phases Updates

### Phase 2 (Post-MVP):
1. **Optional cloud backup**: End-to-end encrypted cloud storage option
2. **Real-time features**: WebSocket for live processing updates
3. **Advanced analytics**: Trend analysis and insights
4. **Health app integration**: Apple HealthKit, Google Fit
5. **Multi-device sync**: Encrypted synchronization across devices

### Phase 3 (Scale):
1. **Family accounts**: Shared health data management
2. **Provider integration**: Healthcare system connections
3. **AI model improvements**: Personalized health insights
4. **Wearable integration**: Continuous health monitoring
