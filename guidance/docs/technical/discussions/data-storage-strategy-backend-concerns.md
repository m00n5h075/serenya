# Backend Engineer Concerns - Data Storage Strategy

**Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Decision**: Store user health data locally on devices, not on Serenya's servers  
**Status**: Backend Architecture Under Review  

## Backend Architecture Transformation

This decision **fundamentally changes our backend architecture** from a traditional healthcare data platform to a stateless processing service, requiring complete redesign of our data handling, API patterns, and infrastructure approach.

## Architecture Simplification Benefits ✅

### Stateless Processing Advantages
- **No Database Management**: Eliminate RDS, DynamoDB setup, maintenance, and scaling
- **No Backup Systems**: No need for database backups, point-in-time recovery, or disaster recovery
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler architecture with processing-only focus
- **Cost Reduction**: Massive reduction in database hosting and storage costs

### Scalability Benefits
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless processing scales infinitely without database bottlenecks
- **Performance**: No database query optimization or connection pooling needed
- **Load Distribution**: Processing requests can be distributed across any available compute
- **Auto-scaling**: Simple compute-based auto-scaling without database coordination

### Security Simplification
- **No PHI Storage**: Cannot have data breaches of data we don't store
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: No database to secure, no persistent storage to encrypt
- **Simpler Compliance**: HIPAA compliance focuses on processing only, not storage
- **Audit Simplification**: Processing-only audit trails without PHI storage

## New Technical Challenges ⚠️

### 1. Session Management Redesign
**Challenge**: Secure temporary processing workflows without data persistence

**Requirements**:
- **Ephemeral Sessions**: Processing sessions that exist only during active processing
- **Memory Management**: All data processing must happen in RAM
- **Session Security**: Secure processing tokens and temporary data encryption
- **Cleanup Automation**: Guaranteed cleanup of temporary processing data

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **Session Tokens**: JWT-based processing tokens with short expiration
- **Memory Limits**: Strict memory allocation to prevent data leakage
- **Processing Timeouts**: Automatic cleanup for abandoned processing sessions
- **Isolation**: Complete isolation between concurrent processing sessions

### 2. Client-Server Protocol Redesign
**Challenge**: New patterns for upload→process→download→delete workflows

**API Pattern Changes**:
```
Traditional Pattern:
User → Upload Data → Store in DB → Process → Store Results → Retrieve Results

New Pattern:
User → Upload Data → Process in Memory → Return Results → Delete Everything
```

**Protocol Requirements**:
- **Streaming Processing**: Handle large medical documents without intermediate storage
- **Real-time Results**: Return processing results immediately without storage
- **Error Handling**: Handle processing failures without retry mechanisms
- **Progress Tracking**: Provide processing progress without state storage

### 3. Mobile API Optimization
**Challenge**: APIs optimized for mobile-first, offline-capable applications

**Mobile-Specific Requirements**:
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Efficient data transfer for mobile networks
- **Offline Capability**: Support for offline processing and sync when reconnected
- **Battery Efficiency**: Minimize mobile device battery impact
- **Platform Integration**: Native integration with iOS/Android storage and security

**API Design Considerations**:
- **Chunked Processing**: Break large medical documents into processable chunks
- **Compression**: Optimize data transfer for mobile bandwidth constraints
- **Caching**: Client-side caching for frequently accessed processing results
- **Background Processing**: Support for mobile background processing limitations

## Implementation Architecture

### Stateless Processing Pipeline
```
Mobile App → API Gateway → Lambda/ECS Processing → AI Services → Results → Mobile App
                     ↓                                              ↓
              Temporary Storage                                Delete Immediately
              (Memory Only)
```

### Core Components

### Data Flow Architecture

#### Medical Document Processing
```
1. Mobile app uploads medical document (PDF, image, text)
2. API Gateway validates and routes to processing service
3. Processing service loads document into memory
4. AI services (Claude, Comprehend Medical) process document
5. Results formatted and returned to mobile app
6. All processing data immediately deleted
7. Mobile app stores results locally on device
```

#### Healthcare Service Integration
```
1. FHIR data processing (if needed) happens in memory only
2. Comprehend Medical NLP processing without result storage
3. Textract document extraction with immediate result return
4. All healthcare service results returned directly to client
```

## Technical Implementation Questions

### 1. Large File Processing
**Question**: How do we handle large file processing (lab PDFs, images) without storage?
**Considerations**:
- **Memory Limits**: AWS Lambda has 10GB memory limit
- **Processing Time**: Lambda has 15-minute execution limit
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum file sizes for in-memory processing
- **Streaming Options**: Stream processing for very large files

**Proposed Solutions**:
- ECS/Fargate containers for large file processing (no memory limits)
- File size limits with user guidance for optimization
- Streaming processing for extremely large medical documents
- Client-side file optimization before upload

### 2. AI Model Updates
**Question**: What's our strategy for AI model updates when clients are offline?
**Considerations**:
