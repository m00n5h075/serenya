# DevOps - Simplified Data Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Device-only storage with temporary server processing  

## Understanding ✅

- **No Permanent Storage**: Only temporary file storage during processing
- **Server-Side Retry**: Temporary storage allows retry mechanisms
- **Flutter Mobile**: Single platform deployment focus
- **Cost Reduction**: No database hosting, backup, or long-term storage
- **Simplified Compliance**: No PHI storage = reduced HIPAA scope

## Key Questions - ANSWERED ✅

1. **Temporary Storage Infrastructure**: S3 temporary buckets with auto-delete policies?
   - **ANSWER**: Yes, implement S3 temporary buckets with auto-delete

2. **Cleanup Automation**: Lambda cleanup functions or S3 lifecycle policies?
   - **ANSWER**: DevOps Engineer's judgment - choose optimal cleanup approach

3. **Processing Timeout**: Max processing time before cleanup/failure?
   - **ANSWER**: 3 minutes default, adjust during testing based on average request duration

4. **Retry Storage**: How long keep files for retry attempts?
   - **ANSWER**: Maximum 1 day retention for retry attempts

5. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: CloudWatch for processing-only metrics?
   - **ANSWER**: At DevOps preference - implement preferred monitoring approach

## DevOps Engineer Next Steps

1. **Choose Cleanup Strategy**: Decide between Lambda cleanup functions vs S3 lifecycle policies
2. **Design S3 Architecture**: Temporary buckets with encryption and auto-delete policies
3. **Implement Monitoring**: Choose optimal monitoring solution for processing-only infrastructure
4. **Processing Pipeline**: Design 3-minute timeout with 1-day max retry retention

## DevOps Technical Decisions

- **Cleanup Method**: Lambda vs S3 lifecycle policies for automated cleanup
- **Monitoring Stack**: CloudWatch vs alternative monitoring solutions
- **Infrastructure Optimization**: Cost and performance optimization for temporary processing
