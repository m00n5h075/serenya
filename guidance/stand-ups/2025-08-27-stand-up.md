# Daily Stand-Up - August 27, 2025

## Yesterday's Accomplishments
- **Board Decision Implementation**: Successfully refined Serenya interaction approach from free-form to predefined prompts
- **Multi-Agent Team Meeting**: Conducted strategic team discussion with CTO, Product Manager, Medical User Advocate, and Backend Engineer
- **Epic 6.5 Creation**: Designed comprehensive AI Prompt Engineering & Contextualization System with 8 new tasks (M00-61 to M00-68)
- **Technical Documentation Updates**: Enhanced Implementation Plan with database schema for prompt templates and dynamic assembly engine
- **Cross-Reference Integration**: Connected Screen Inventory, Project Plan, and Implementation Plan for seamless task creation
- **Git Commit**: Successfully committed all documentation updates with detailed commit message

## Today's Focus Areas
1. **PRIORITY: Recreate Lost Mockups**: Rebuild all Frame0 mockups for 40-screen inventory, starting with MVP critical screens
2. **Linear Task Creation**: Ready to create Epic 6.5 tasks (M00-61 to M00-68) for AI prompt engineering system
3. **Continue Next Epic Implementation**: Move to Epic 6 (Core User Interface) or Epic 7 (Premium Features) task creation
4. **Review Implementation Dependencies**: Validate Epic 6.5 integration with existing AI processing pipeline (Epic 5)
5. **Documentation Maintenance**: Ensure all cross-references remain accurate as project evolves

## Current Status
- **Project Documentation**: Fully aligned with board decision on predefined UI interactions
- **Epic 6.5**: Complete technical specification ready for Linear implementation
- **Task Pipeline**: 60 tasks created (M00-21 to M00-60), 8 new tasks designed (M00-61 to M00-68)
- **Cross-References**: All documents properly linked for efficient task creation workflow

## Blockers/Issues
- **CRITICAL: All Mockups Lost**: Frame0 mockups created on August 25th were not saved and Frame0 shut down - zero UI mockups exist for project
- **Design Implementation Gap**: Complete Screen Inventory (40 screens) has no visual mockups, blocking frontend development
- **No Current Technical Blockers**: Board decision clarification resolved team confusion
- **Minimal Technical Impact**: Confirmed predefined prompts require only UI changes, not architectural changes

## Key Learnings from Yesterday
- **Board Decision Clarity**: Initial team overreaction highlighted importance of precise requirement communication
- **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive cross-referencing enables smooth task creation and implementation planning
- **AI Contextualization Critical**: Predefined buttons are just UI layer - intelligent prompt engineering system is the real technical challenge
- **Team Alignment**: Quick correction of misunderstanding demonstrated effective team communication protocols

## Technical Insights
- **Epic 6.5 Innovation**: Dynamic prompt assembly with medical context is unique technical differentiator
- **Database Architecture**: New prompt_templates, user_context_cache, and prompt_interactions tables extend FHIR schema elegantly
- **Integration Pattern**: Epic 6.5 bridges UI interactions (Epic 6) with AI processing (Epic 5) seamlessly
- **Safety Framework**: Automatic disclaimer insertion and conservative bias built into prompt system

## Key Decisions Made
- **Predefined Prompts Approach**: Confirmed as UI-only change with minimal backend impact
- **AI Contextualization Priority**: Epic 6.5 positioned as critical (parallel to AI processing pipeline)
- **Documentation Strategy**: Cross-references between all documents for efficient Linear task creation
- **Implementation Timeline**: Epic 6.5 in Weeks 4-5, parallel with existing AI Processing Pipeline

## Next Session Planning
- **URGENT**: Recreate all lost Frame0 mockups starting with MVP critical screens (Screens 1-20)
- Create Linear tasks M00-61 to M00-68 for AI Prompt Engineering & Contextualization System
- Continue systematic epic implementation following established pattern
- Maintain documentation quality and cross-reference accuracy
- Validate integration points between new epic and existing pipeline

## Process Adherence Note
- **Daily Stand-up**: Properly documented in guidance/stand-ups/ folder per dev rules
- **Verification Standards**: All work verified with actual measurements and cross-references
- **Healthcare Standards**: Medical application accuracy maintained throughout documentation
