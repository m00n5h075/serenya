# Daily Standup - August 29, 2025

## Yesterday's Accomplishments
- **✅ Completed 4-slide onboarding flow in Frame0** with full design system compliance
  - Created all 4 slides: Welcome, Privacy, Important Things to Know, Ready to Get Started
  - Fixed vertical spacing violations across all slides (8px/16px/20px hierarchy)
  - Applied user-requested copy changes (navigation language, consolidated checkboxes)
  - Added progress indicators with proper states (1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4)
  - Applied trust green color to "Your trust is everything to us" text
  - Positioned buttons at bottom with centered text
- **✅ Investigated missing Linear tasks M00-099 through M00-095** - confirmed these don't exist in the system
- **🔍 Discovered title/content mismatches** in Linear tasks M00-100 through M00-104 requiring fixes

## Today's Focus Areas
- **🎯 Fix Linear task title/content mismatches** for M00-100 through M00-104 (titles don't match descriptions)
- **📋 Continue Linear batch updates** for remaining 20 tasks (M00-095 through M00-076)
- **📄 Document Linear API investigation findings** about missing/mismatched tasks
- **🚨 Create AI Safety & Error Handling screens** for Phase 2 development

## Blockers
- **Frame0 PNG export limitation**: Cannot programmatically save PNG files to filesystem via MCP server - export functions only display images in conversation, don't save actual files to mock-ups folder

## Key Learnings
- **Design system compliance verification is critical**: Found extensive spacing violations that required systematic measurement and correction across all slides
- **Frame0 MCP server limitations**: Export functions provide visual display but not filesystem integration for automated file saving
- **Linear task data inconsistency**: Task titles don't match their actual content descriptions, requiring systematic correction

## Planning Decisions
1. **Priority 1**: Fix Linear task title/content mismatches to ensure accurate project tracking
2. **Priority 2**: Complete remaining Linear batch updates to maintain task management consistency  
3. **Priority 3**: Begin Phase 2 AI Safety screens once Linear tasks are resolved
4. **Note**: PNG export issue requires manual intervention - recommend manual export via Frame0 UI to downloads, then move to mock-ups folder
