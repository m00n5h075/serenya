# Daily Stand-up - August 31, 2025

## Yesterday's accomplishments
- ✅ **Backend Endpoint Gap Analysis** - Comprehensive analysis identifying 25-30 missing endpoints for app management
- ✅ **Critical Path Documentation** - 5-phase implementation plan with 23-34 day timeline  
- ✅ **Business Impact Assessment** - Risk analysis showing MVP launch blockers
- ✅ **Technical Documentation** - Analysis saved to `/guidance/docs/technical/backend-endpoint-gap-analysis.md`

## Today's focus areas
- Awaiting direction on priorities
- Ready to implement Phase 1 endpoints (Essential Settings - 5 endpoints)
- Available for any MVP critical path work

## Identify any blockers
- No technical blockers
- Need direction on whether to proceed with Phase 1 backend endpoints or shift focus

## Summarize key learnings
- Current backend has strong core (7 endpoints functional) but significant gaps in app management
- 40 UI screens remain completely undesigned (previous docs were incorrect)
- Legal framework is critical blocker - cannot launch without proper onboarding disclaimers

## Make planning decisions based on priority and daily goals
**Decision needed:** Prioritization between:
1. Phase 1 backend endpoints (user profile, settings, legal docs access)
2. UI/UX design work (40 screens, starting with legal onboarding)  
3. Different focus area

**Status:** Awaiting founder direction on next steps.
