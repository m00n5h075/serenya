## Yesterday's Accomplishments

### Linear Task Template Enhancement (Major Progress)
- **Completed**: 47 Linear tasks updated with comprehensive healthcare-focused templates
- **Methodology**: Enhanced each task with Prerequisites & Dependencies, QA Testing Criteria, Medical Safety Checklists, and Required Handover Documentation
- **Coverage**: Batches 1-3 completed (30 tasks), Batch 4 partially completed (17/21 tasks)
- **Healthcare Focus**: All tasks enhanced with HIPAA/GDPR compliance, FHIR integration, medical safety protocols

### Critical UI/UX Design Delivery 
- **Analysis**: Comprehensive product/mockups folder review revealing 0/40 screens existed (critical gap)
- **Priority Implementation**: Created 6 highest-priority onboarding screens in Frame0
- **Legal Compliance**: Addressed launch-blocking liability risks through proper disclaimer/consent flow
- **Mobile-First**: 320px optimization with healthcare-appropriate design system
- **Quality Fix**: Corrected button text alignment on Slide 4 per feedback

## Today's Focus Areas

### Priority 1: Continue Critical Screen Development
- **Next Target**: AI safety & error handling flow (4-5 screens)
- **Business Critical**: Handles 10-15% expected AI processing failure rate
- **Medical Safety**: Confidence scoring, medical consultation triggers, error recovery

### Priority 2: Resolve Linear API Investigation
- **Issue**: 5 tasks (M00-099, M00-098, M00-097, M00-096, M00-095) return "Entity not found"
- **Evidence**: User confirms seeing tasks in Linear UI but API cannot access
- **Additional**: Fix title/content mismatches in M00-100 through M00-104

## Blockers Identified

### Technical Blocker: Linear API Discrepancy
- **Severity**: Medium - affects task completion tracking but not core development
- **Investigation Needed**: Manual Linear UI check vs API behavior
- **Pattern**: Systematic gaps in M00-090s range suggests data integrity issue

### Design System Validation Needed
- **Challenge**: Need to validate mobile constraints (272px content width) work with complex medical terminology
- **Evidence Required**: Real medical content testing within design constraints

---

## Key Learnings

### Healthcare Development Complexity
- **Compliance Integration**: Every task requires medical safety, GDPR Article 9, HIPAA considerations
- **Design Standards**: Healthcare UI demands higher trust-building and anxiety-aware patterns
- **Legal Protection**: Onboarding screens are true launch blockers due to liability exposure

### Agent Coordination Success
- **Systematic Approach**: Batch processing with verification requirements working well
- **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive progress tracking enables smooth handoffs
- **Template Standardization**: Healthcare-focused templates significantly improve task quality

## Planning Decisions for Today

### Resource Allocation Decision
**Question**: Continue design work (immediate user value) vs. resolve Linear API issues (system hygiene)?
**Recommendation**: Prioritize design work - screens are launch-critical, Linear tasks are tracking/organization

### Quality Standards Application
**Evidence-Based Verification**: All design work must include exact coordinate verification per healthcare application standards
**Medical Safety Priority**: Every screen must validate anxiety-aware messaging and trust-building elements

### Daily Goals
1. **Design Delivery**: Complete AI safety flow screens (4-5 screens)
2. **System Investigation**: Dedicate focused time to Linear API issue resolution
3. **Quality Validation**: Verify all design work meets healthcare application standards

## Discussion Points & Founder Decisions

**Challenge First, Agree Later**: 
- Is continuing design work the right priority when we have system integrity issues?
- Are we properly balancing speed vs. medical safety in screen development?

**Evidence-Based Question**: 
- What data supports prioritizing screen development over Linear API resolution?
- How do we measure success for healthcare-appropriate design implementation?

**Authentic Concern**: 
- Linear API issues suggest potential broader system reliability problems
- Need to ensure healthcare application accuracy standards are truly being met

## Founder Direction & Strategic Decisions

**Priority Resolution - Screen Development First**:
*Founder Decision*: Focus on screen development before system reliability issues. 

*Rationale*: "It is important at this point to fully understand what the screens will need, what the feature set is going to be, so that we can identify gaps and address those as soon as possible. We will fully build out the tool in this UI from these mock ups. Only then, when we are confident in what we're building, will we proceed with implementing everything else, such as the infrastructure and so on."

**Resource Allocation Strategy**:
1. **Phase 1**: Minor touch-ups on existing onboarding screens
2. **Phase 2**: Continue with AI safety & error handling screen development  
3. **Phase 3**: Address Linear API issues (secondary priority)
4. **Goal**: Solve both design completion and Linear issues by end of day

**Strategic Context**: Design-first approach to validate complete feature set before infrastructure investment. This ensures we build the right thing before building it right.
