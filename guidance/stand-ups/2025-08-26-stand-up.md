# Daily Stand-Up - August 26, 2025

## Yesterday's Accomplishments
- **Agent Team Launched**: Successfully deployed 6 specialized AI agents (CTO, Backend Engineer, DevOps, QA, Marketing, UI/UX Designer)
- **Comprehensive Project Analysis**: Agents provided detailed reviews revealing excellent planning but zero implementation
- **Design System Issues Resolved**: Updated UI/UX Designer workflow and enhanced design system documentation
- **Onboarding Screen Standardization**: Fixed positioning alignment between Slides 2-3, resolved icon/emoji redundancy
- **Enhanced Design System**: Updated README.md with comprehensive color palette, typography scale, and usage guidelines

## Today's Focus Areas
1. **Complete comprehensive design system review** of all 6 onboarding slides
2. **Apply final spacing and anchoring corrections** (titles to top, buttons to bottom)
3. **Validate all screens** meet design system compliance
4. **Present finalized screens** for approval before PNG export
5. **Begin next priority screens** from the 40-screen inventory

## Current Status
- **6 onboarding screens** created in Frame0 with improved consistency
- **Design system** fully documented with expanded standards
- **UI/UX workflow** updated with validation review step

## Blockers/Issues
- **QA Critical Alert**: Zero testing infrastructure for healthcare application (needs immediate attention)
- **Implementation Gap**: €75K testing framework investment required before development
- **Timeline Risk**: 8-10 week MVP timeline aggressive without development team

## Key Findings from Agent Analysis
- **Excellent Architecture**: €1M+ cost savings through hybrid approach, mature compliance planning
- **Zero Implementation**: All comprehensive documentation, no actual codebase exists
- **DevOps Maturity**: 9/10 planning score, container-ready for scaling
- **Testing Crisis**: No framework exists for healthcare application - immediate priority

## Key Decisions Needed
- Approval of corrected onboarding screens
- Next priority screens to design (20 MVP critical screens total)  
- Development team hiring timeline
- Testing framework implementation approach

## Daily Process Improvement Note
**Issue Identified**: Stand-ups were not being saved to `guidance/stand-ups/` folder as specified in our dev rules
**Resolution**: Implementing proper documentation process going forward
