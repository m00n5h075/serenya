# Screen Implementation Workflow

This workflow ensures design system compliance from the start, eliminating the need for post-creation fixes.

## Phase 1: Planning (REQUIRED)
**Never skip this phase. Planning prevents problems.**

1. **Complete Screen Planning Template**
   - Fill out `/guidance/mock-ups/SCREEN_PLANNING_TEMPLATE.md` completely
   - Calculate exact positions and measurements
   - Verify design system compliance on paper first

2. **Review Against Design System**
   - Check `/guidance/mock-ups/README.md` comprehensive design system
   - Ensure all typography, colors, and spacing choices are documented
   - Confirm all elements fit within 320×690px frame and 272px content width

3. **Get Approval** 
   - Present completed planning template
   - Confirm all specifications before implementation

## Phase 2: Implementation
**Execute the plan exactly as specified.**

1. **Create Frame**
   - Use exact positioning from plan
   - Verify frame dimensions (320×690px)

2. **Implement Elements Sequentially**
   - Follow the planned creation order
   - Use exact measurements from planning template
   - Apply design system specifications precisely
   - Create each element with final specifications (no "fix later" mentality)

3. **Real-Time Verification**
   - Measure each element after creation
   - Confirm positions match planning template
   - Verify design system compliance immediately

## Phase 3: Final Verification
**Ensure 100% compliance before marking complete.**

1. **Complete System Check**
   - Typography: All sizes match hierarchy (26px/20px/18px/16px)
   - Colors: All elements follow usage guidelines
   - Spacing: All gaps follow 8px/16px/20px system
   - Layout: All elements within safe area, no overlaps

2. **Export Immediately**
   - Save PNG to appropriate folder
   - Document completion in project tracking

3. **Only Report Success When Verified**
   - Never claim completion without measurement proof
   - Provide exact measurements that confirm compliance

## Quality Standards
**Zero tolerance for "fix later" mentality:**
- Planning phase is mandatory, not optional
- Implementation must match planning exactly
- Verification must be measurement-based, not assumption-based
- No screen is "complete" until compliance is mathematically proven

## Workflow Benefits
This approach ensures:
- ✅ First-time compliance with design system
- ✅ No post-creation rework needed
- ✅ Consistent quality across all screens
- ✅ Predictable implementation timeline
- ✅ Professional design standards

## When Problems Arise
**If implementation doesn't match planning:**
1. Stop implementation immediately
2. Identify the root cause (planning error vs. implementation error)
3. Fix the planning template if needed
4. Restart implementation with corrected plan
5. Never "work around" problems - fix them properly

**Remember**: Measure twice, cut once. Thorough planning eliminates the iterate-and-fix cycle that wastes time and creates inconsistency.
