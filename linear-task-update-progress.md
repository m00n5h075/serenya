# Linear Task Template Update Progress

**Date**: August 28, 2025  
**Task**: Update all existing Linear tasks with new template structure  
**Status**: In Progress - Batch 4 Issues Identified

## Update Description & Methodology

### What Updates Are Being Applied:
Each Linear task is being enhanced with comprehensive new template sections based on `/guidance/docs/project/linear-task-templates.md`:

1. **Prerequisites & Dependencies**: Specific task mappings showing what must be completed before starting each task
2. **Enhanced Technical Requirements**: Healthcare-focused requirements with HIPAA/GDPR compliance integration
3. **Comprehensive QA Testing Criteria**: Detailed testing requirements including medical safety validation
4. **Medical Safety Checklists**: Healthcare-specific safety protocols and clinical workflow considerations
5. **Required Handover Documentation**: Structured handover requirements for different team specializations (Backend, Frontend, QA, Medical Compliance, etc.)

### How Updates Are Being Performed:
- **Method**: Using Linear API `mcp__linear__update_issue` function with complete description replacement
- **Batch Size**: 10 tasks initially, increased to 20 tasks per user request
- **Approach**: Sequential processing from highest task numbers downward (M00-145 → M00-021)
- **Template Source**: All enhancements based on comprehensive task templates in linear-task-templates.md
- **Healthcare Focus**: Every task enhanced with medical compliance, FHIR integration, and clinical safety considerations

### Template Enhancement Examples:
- **Infrastructure tasks**: Enhanced with healthcare cloud architecture requirements and HIPAA compliance
- **Security tasks**: Expanded with medical data protection and healthcare-specific threat modeling
- **Frontend tasks**: Added anxiety-aware healthcare design patterns and medical information hierarchy
- **Backend tasks**: Integrated FHIR schema requirements and medical data processing standards
- **QA tasks**: Enhanced with medical safety testing protocols and clinical workflow validation

### Quality Assurance Process:
- Each task receives agent-specific handover documentation (Infrastructure, Backend, Frontend, Product Management, Design, Medical/Compliance, QA, Architecture/CTO)
- Medical safety checklists added to all tasks touching healthcare data or user experience
- Prerequisites clearly mapped to create proper task dependency chains
- Healthcare compliance integrated throughout (GDPR Article 9, HIPAA, medical device regulations)

## Progress Summary

### Completed Batches:
- **Batch 1**: M00-145 through M00-136 (10 tasks) ✅
- **Batch 2**: M00-135 through M00-126 (10 tasks) ✅  
- **Batch 3**: M00-125 through M00-116 (10 tasks) ✅
- **Batch 4**: M00-115 through M00-096 (21 tasks completed) ✅
- **Batch 5**: M00-95 through M00-92 (4 out of 4 tasks completed in current session) ✅

### Total Progress:
- **Tasks Successfully Updated**: 51 tasks
- **Tasks with Title/Content Mismatches Fixed**: 5 tasks (M00-100 through M00-104)
- **Previously Missing Tasks Updated**: 4 tasks (M00-99, M00-98, M00-97, M00-96)
- **Remaining Tasks**: ~47 tasks (M00-91 down to M00-21)

## RESOLVED Issues - Linear ID Format Discovery

### Missing Tasks Issue RESOLVED:
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Linear uses non-zero-padded task IDs
- **M00-099, M00-098, M00-097, M00-096** don't exist because Linear uses **M00-99, M00-98, M00-97, M00-96**
- **API Confirmation**: All tasks exist and are accessible using correct non-padded format
- **Documentation Error**: Previous documentation assumed zero-padding that doesn't match Linear's actual format

### Title/Content Mismatches Discovered:
- **M00-100**: Title: "IAM policies" → Content: "Healthcare data anonymization"
- **M00-101**: Title: "AWS BAA HIPAA" → Content: "Redis caching strategies"  
- **M00-102**: Title: "Audit logging" → Content: "Network security configuration"
- **M00-103**: Title: "Data export/deletion" → Content: "Security hardening"
- **M00-104**: Title: "CloudWatch metrics" → Content: "KMS encryption"

### Template Updates Applied:
Each completed task enhanced with:
- **Prerequisites & Dependencies** with specific task mappings
- **Enhanced Technical Requirements** with healthcare compliance
- **Comprehensive QA Testing Criteria**
- **Medical Safety Checklists**
- **Required Handover Documentation** for different teams

## Current Status & Next Actions:

### Completed In Current Session:
1. ✅ **Fixed title/content mismatches** in M00-100 through M00-104 (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ **Updated batch processing** to use correct non-padded format (COMPLETED)
3. ✅ **Updated M00-95 through M00-92** with comprehensive template enhancements (COMPLETED)

### Current Session Progress:
- **M00-95**: Build layered information disclosure system (Enhanced with healthcare-focused progressive disclosure)
- **M00-94**: Medical boundaries and disclaimers (Enhanced with comprehensive legal protection framework)
- **M00-93**: Layered information disclosure system (Enhanced with medical content classification)
- **M00-92**: Create anxiety-aware interface design patterns (Enhanced with anxiety-aware healthcare interface)

### Next Immediate Actions:
1. **Continue with M00-91**: Implement emergency care detection for critical lab values
2. **Complete remaining batch**: M00-91 through M00-76 (16 more tasks)
3. **Maintain template consistency**: Apply same comprehensive enhancement pattern

### Linear ID Format Documentation:
- **Correct Format**: M00-1, M00-2, M00-21, M00-95, M00-100, M00-145
- **Incorrect Assumptions**: M00-001, M00-002, M00-021, M00-095, etc.
- **API Calls**: Must use exact Linear format without zero-padding

## Template Structure Reference:
- Healthcare-focused enhancements applied to all tasks
- FHIR compliance integration
- Medical safety protocols
- Progressive handover documentation
- Comprehensive QA with medical safety validation
