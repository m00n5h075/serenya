- **Batch Size**: Process 20 tasks maximum per batch
- **Verification**: Always confirm updates with get_issue() calls
- **Error Handling**: Document any API errors or missing tasks

### Medical Safety Considerations

### Step 3: Ready to Work
After reading those 2 files, ask: *"What should I work on first?"*

**That's it. You now have:**
- Current project state and immediate priorities (this document)
- Work standards and verification requirements (dev rules)  
- Systematic task execution process (workflow protocol)
- Complete context to pick up any task effectively
