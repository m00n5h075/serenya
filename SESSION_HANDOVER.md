```

**Flutter App Integration:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Updated `app_constants.dart` with deployed API URL
- Auth endpoint corrected to match deployed structure  
- All service contracts aligned with deployed backend

## 🎯 CURRENT PRIORITY: Production Readiness & Testing

The backend is deployed and integrated. Critical path forward:

### 1. Production Credentials Setup
- **Google Cloud Setup**: ⏳ IN PROGRESS - User started Google Cloud Console organization setup
  - ✅ Selected "Production" foundational architecture (appropriate for healthcare app)
  - ⏳ PAUSED at "Users and Groups" step (Step 2 of setup wizard)
  - 🎯 NEXT: Complete user setup (add self as Owner/Project Editor), skip groups for now
  - 🎯 AFTER SETUP: Create OAuth 2.0 application with client ID/secret for Serenya
- Set up Anthropic API key for AI processing (currently using mock responses)
- Review and update security policies for production

### 2. End-to-End Testing & Validation
- Test complete upload → processing → results workflow
- Validate medical safety disclaimers and confidence scoring
- Test authentication flow with real Google credentials
- Performance testing and monitoring setup

### 3. Production Deployment Pipeline
- Set up production environment stack
- Configure domain and SSL certificates
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for updates
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerts

## Technical Architecture Status

### Flutter App Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

**Device-Only Storage Philosophy:**
- Health documents encrypted locally using SQLite with dynamic keys
- Temporary server processing with automatic deletion after interpretation
- No persistent storage of health data on servers
- All sensitive data remains on user's device

**Upload & Processing Workflow:**
- Non-blocking upload with persistent button states (idle → loading → results ready)
- Progressive retry mechanism: 30s → 2m → 5m with vibration feedback
- 3-minute timeout alignment between client and server
- Background processing monitoring with real-time status updates

**Medical Safety Framework:**
- Conservative bias in all AI interpretations
- Multi-tier disclaimer system (general, emergency, consultation, privacy)
- Confidence-based consultation triggers
- Medical flags for abnormal findings

## Critical Configuration Details

### Database Schema (SQLite with Encryption - Implemented)
```sql
-- Core document storage
health_documents: id, file_name, file_type, file_size, upload_date, 
                  processing_status, ai_confidence_score, interpretation_text

-- AI interpretations
interpretations: id, document_id, interpretation_type, confidence_score, 
                interpretation_text, medical_flags

-- User preferences & consent tracking
user_preferences: preference_key, preference_value
consent_records: consent_type, consent_given, consent_date, version
```

### Medical Safety Configuration (Implemented)
```dart
// Confidence thresholds trigger different UI behaviors
lowConfidenceThreshold: 3.0     // Show basic disclaimer
moderateConfidenceThreshold: 6.0 // Suggest doctor consultation
highConfidenceThreshold: 7.0     // Full confidence in results

// Retry configuration for robust processing
maxRetryAttempts: 3
retryDelaySeconds: [30, 120, 300] // Progressive backoff
processingTimeoutMinutes: 3       // Aligned with backend Lambda timeout
```

### API Configuration ✅ DEPLOYED & INTEGRATED
```dart
// lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart
baseApiUrl: 'https://bpzha55z9e.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev'
processingEndpoint: '/api/v1/process'

## 🚀 **AGENT STARTUP PROTOCOL - PRODUCTION READINESS FOCUS**

**Current Work Scope: Production Deployment & End-to-End Testing**

### Step 1: Read This Document ✅ 
You're reading it now. **Key Context**: Both Flutter app AND backend are complete and deployed - we need production setup and testing.

### Step 2: Review Deployed Infrastructure
1. **Backend Status Check**: 
   ```bash
   cd /Users/m00n5h075ai/development/serenya/serenya_app/backend
   npx cdk ls  # List deployed stacks
   ```
2. **API Verification**: Backend deployed at `https://bpzha55z9e.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev`
3. **Flutter Integration**: App configured to use deployed backend in `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`

### Step 3: Production Readiness Tasks
1. **Credentials Setup**: Replace mock values in AWS Secrets Manager with real:
   - **Google OAuth client ID/secret**: ⏳ Google Cloud setup in progress (paused at Users/Groups step)
   - Anthropic API key for AI processing
   - JWT secret for production security
2. **Security Review**: Validate all endpoints have proper authentication
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure CloudWatch dashboards and alerts

### Step 4: End-to-End Testing
**Your immediate focus should be:**
- **Authentication Flow**: Test Google OAuth → JWT token generation
- **Upload Processing**: Document upload → AI processing → results retrieval  
- **Error Handling**: Test retry mechanisms and timeout scenarios
- **Medical Safety**: Verify confidence scoring and disclaimers work correctly

**Success Criteria**: Complete user journey works from Flutter app through AWS backend with real credentials

### Step 5: Production Deployment
1. **Production Stack**: Deploy production environment with proper security
2. **Domain Setup**: Configure custom domain and SSL certificates
3. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and monitoring
4. **Documentation**: Update deployment guides and troubleshooting docs
