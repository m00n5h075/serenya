# Serenya Project - Session Handover Document

**Last Updated:** August 31, 2025  
**Development Status:** Core Flutter Foundation Complete - Ready for Backend Integration  
**Project Root:** `/Users/m00n5h075ai/development/serenya/`

## Project Overview

**Serenya** is an AI Health Agent mobile app that provides secure, device-only storage for health documents with cloud-based AI interpretation. The app prioritizes privacy, medical safety, and user trust through comprehensive disclaimers and conservative bias.

Core positioning: "Your friendly AI nurse that helps you understand your lab results and empowers better conversations with your healthcare provider."

## 🎯 CURRENT PRIORITY: Backend Integration (Priority 1)

The Flutter app is complete and waiting for backend services. Critical path forward:

### 1. AWS Lambda Setup Required
- Deploy processing service with 3-minute timeout
- Implement job status tracking endpoints
- Configure secure file upload/download
- Set up automatic cleanup after processing

### 2. API Endpoints to Implement
```
POST /api/v1/auth/google          # Google OAuth verification
POST /api/v1/process              # Document upload & processing
GET  /api/v1/process/{job_id}     # Status polling
GET  /api/v1/interpret/{job_id}   # Get AI results
POST /api/v1/process/{job_id}/retry # Retry failed processing
```

### 3. AI Integration Setup
- Implement mock AI responses for testing
- Configure confidence scoring algorithm
- Set up medical flag detection system
- Create sample interpretation data

## Technical Architecture Status

### Flutter App Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

**Device-Only Storage Philosophy:**
- Health documents encrypted locally using SQLite with dynamic keys
- Temporary server processing with automatic deletion after interpretation
- No persistent storage of health data on servers
- All sensitive data remains on user's device

**Upload & Processing Workflow:**
- Non-blocking upload with persistent button states (idle → loading → results ready)
- Progressive retry mechanism: 30s → 2m → 5m with vibration feedback
- 3-minute timeout alignment between client and server
- Background processing monitoring with real-time status updates

**Medical Safety Framework:**
- Conservative bias in all AI interpretations
- Multi-tier disclaimer system (general, emergency, consultation, privacy)
- Confidence-based consultation triggers
- Medical flags for abnormal findings

## Critical Configuration Details

### Database Schema (SQLite with Encryption - Implemented)
```sql
-- Core document storage
health_documents: id, file_name, file_type, file_size, upload_date, 
                  processing_status, ai_confidence_score, interpretation_text

-- AI interpretations
interpretations: id, document_id, interpretation_type, confidence_score, 
                interpretation_text, medical_flags

-- User preferences & consent tracking
user_preferences: preference_key, preference_value
consent_records: consent_type, consent_given, consent_date, version
```

### Medical Safety Configuration (Implemented)
```dart
// Confidence thresholds trigger different UI behaviors
lowConfidenceThreshold: 3.0     // Show basic disclaimer
moderateConfidenceThreshold: 6.0 // Suggest doctor consultation
highConfidenceThreshold: 7.0     // Full confidence in results

// Retry configuration for robust processing
maxRetryAttempts: 3
retryDelaySeconds: [30, 120, 300] // Progressive backoff
processingTimeoutMinutes: 3       // Aligned with backend Lambda timeout
```

### API Configuration (Ready for Backend)
```dart
// lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart
baseApiUrl: 'https://api.serenya.health'
processingEndpoint: '/api/v1/process'
authEndpoint: '/api/v1/auth'
```

- ⏳ AI integration testing pending

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Device-Only Storage:** Chosen SQLite encryption over cloud storage for maximum privacy
2. **Progressive Retry:** Implemented exponential backoff (30s→2m→5m) for robust processing
3. **Conservative Medical Bias:** All AI results include disclaimers and consultation suggestions
4. **State-Driven UI:** Upload button reflects processing state for clear user feedback
5. **Provider Pattern:** Clean separation of UI and business logic for maintainability

## Medical Safety Considerations

- All health-related screens include appropriate disclaimers ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Position as "medical interpretation assistance, not medical advice" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Emphasize "always consult healthcare professionals" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Maintain anxiety-aware, supportive tone ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## 🚀 **AGENT STARTUP PROTOCOL - BACKEND INTEGRATION FOCUS**

**Current Work Scope: Backend Integration for Complete Flutter App**

### Step 1: Read This Document ✅ 
You're reading it now. **Key Context**: Flutter app is 100% complete - we need backend services to match existing API contracts.

### Step 2: Understand Current Architecture
1. **Flutter App Analysis**: 
   ```bash
   cd /Users/m00n5h075ai/development/serenya/serenya_app
   ./test_runner.sh web  # See working app
   ```
2. **API Contract Review**: Read `/serenya_app/lib/services/api_service.dart` to understand expected endpoints
3. **Processing Flow**: Review `/serenya_app/lib/services/processing_service.dart` for retry logic and timeout expectations

### Step 3: Backend Development Setup
1. **Read AWS Requirements**: `/guidance/docs/project/future-phases.md` - Epic 15 AWS infrastructure
2. **Review Development Standards**: `/guidance/docs/technical/our-dev-rules.md`
3. **Check Linear Tasks**: Epic 15 tasks M00-146 through M00-153 contain AWS deployment specifications

### Step 4: Ready to Deploy
**Your immediate focus should be:**
- **AWS Lambda Functions**: Deploy processing service with 3-minute timeout
- **API Gateway**: Create endpoints matching Flutter service contracts  
- **S3 Integration**: Secure file upload/download with automatic cleanup
- **Database**: Job status tracking and processing results storage

**Success Criteria**: Flutter app can upload documents → get processing status → receive AI interpretations

### Step 5: Validation Protocol
1. **End-to-End Testing**: Upload document through Flutter app and verify complete flow
2. **Medical Safety**: Ensure AI responses include proper disclaimers and confidence scores
3. **Performance**: Validate 3-minute timeout alignment and retry mechanisms work
4. **Security**: Confirm no health data persists on servers after processing

**You now have:**
- Complete Flutter app ready for integration
- Clear API contracts to implement
- AWS infrastructure requirements
- Medical safety standards to maintain
