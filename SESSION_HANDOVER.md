### üîÑ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next Session)
1. **Fix title/content mismatches in Linear tasks M00-100 through M00-104**
   - **CRITICAL**: Task titles completely misaligned with descriptions
   - M00-100: Title "IAM policies" vs Content "data anonymization"
   - M00-101: Title "AWS BAA" vs Content "Redis caching"
   - Status: Ready for Linear API batch correction

2. **Continue Linear batch updates for tasks M00-095 through M00-076 (20 tasks)**
   - Part of systematic Linear task template updates
   - 47 tasks already successfully updated
   - Need to continue methodical batch processing

3. **Document Linear API investigation findings**
   - Investigation complete: Tasks M00-096 through M00-099 confirmed NON-EXISTENT
   - Title/content mismatch pattern discovered in M00-100 through M00-104
   - Need formal documentation for project records

### üö® PHASE 2 READY: AI Safety & Error Handling Screens
- **Dependency**: Phase 1 onboarding complete ‚úÖ
- **Next**: Create safety screens for AI processing failures, low confidence warnings, medical consultation recommendations
- **Context**: Use established design system, follow medical safety standards

## Key Technical Context

### Linear Task Management  
- **Methodology**: Documented in `/linear-task-update-progress.md`
- **Progress**: 47/200+ tasks successfully updated with new template
- **Current Issues**: 
  - **CRITICAL**: Title/content mismatches in M00-100 through M00-104 requiring immediate correction
  - Missing tasks M00-096, M00-097, M00-098, M00-099 (confirmed non-existent via API)
  - Batch 5 ready: M00-095 through M00-076 (20 tasks) awaiting template updates

### UI/UX Design System ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Framework**: Mobile-first healthcare design (320px√ó690px frames)
- **Colors**: #2563EB (medical blue), #059669 (trust green), #FFFFFF (backgrounds), #1F2937/#6B7280 (text)
- **Typography**: 26px titles, 20px headers, 18px emphasis, 16px body minimum
- **Spacing**: 8px sub-component, 16px element, 20px component hierarchy ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- **Tools**: Frame0 MCP server (‚ö†Ô∏è Limited: visual export only, no filesystem saves)
- **Status**: 4-slide onboarding flow complete, ready for Phase 2 screens

### Development Workflow
- **Standards**: Follow `/guidance/docs/technical/our-dev-rules.md`
- **Agent Coordination**: Use specialized agents (Product Manager, UI/UX Designer, Medical Advocate)
- **Verification**: Always verify changes with appropriate tools before claiming completion
- **Todo Management**: Use TodoWrite tool extensively for task tracking

## Required Agent Setup & Context

### 1. Product Manager Agent
**Context Needed:**

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Frame0 Design Work
- **MUST READ**: `/guidance/mock-ups/README.md` for complete design system
- **Background**: Always use #FFFFFF (white), never Frame0 defaults
- **Colors**: Use exact hex codes (#2563EB, #1F2937, #6B7280, #9CA3AF)
- **Verification**: Always verify changes with get_page() before claiming completion
- **Exports**: PNG files required in `/guidance/mock-ups/` folder

### Linear Task Updates
- **Template**: Documented in `/linear-task-update-progress.md`
- **Batch Size**: Process 20 tasks maximum per batch
- **Verification**: Always confirm updates with get_issue() calls
- **Error Handling**: Document any API errors or missing tasks

### Medical Safety Considerations
- All health-related screens must include appropriate disclaimers
- Position as "medical interpretation assistance, not medical advice"
- Emphasize "always consult healthcare professionals"
- Maintain anxiety-aware, supportive tone

## Session Startup Commands
